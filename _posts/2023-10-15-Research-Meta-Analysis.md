### 1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

**Null Hypothesis:** The experiment shows no direct correlation between anaerobic performance when the supplement was taken by test subjects.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The experiment shows a direct correlation between anaerobic performance when the supplement was taken by test subjects.

### 2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

The task of collecting and analyzing the data in this study was carried out by a team from several academic departments. Piotr Kaczka, Adam Białek, and Krzysztof Kuzbicki from the Department of Sport Nutrition at the Academy of Physical Education in Katowice led the investigation. They were joined by Artur Różański-Boczula, Izabela Pokrywka-Ślęzak, Marcin Piotr, and Adam Piotr from the Faculty of Physical Education at the University of Rzeszow. The analysis and interpretation phase was a joint effort by Piotr Kaczka, Adam Białek, Krzysztof Kuzbicki, and Monika Michałowska-Sawczyn.

### 3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

The study did not directly reference or use external datasets. However, it heavily references prior research from various studies and publications, which provide context for the present experiment. These references include articles and papers on the effects of caffeine, taurine, beta-alanine, and other supplements on exercise performance and metabolism. All papers referenced have a link attached directing the reader to the original paper where the authors got their information from, all of which are available to the public through websites like PubMed and Google Scholar.

### 4. Why are they interested in this data?

The researchers are interested in understanding the effects of a supplement on anaerobic exercise performance specifically in the lower body. The paper states that most experiments focused on testing preworkout supplements test upper body strength increases and often ignore lower body strength. They also wanted to come to their own conclusion about whether caffeine increases performance or not because they reference multiple studies each coming to different conclusions about the effectiveness of caffeine on resistance training.

### 5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

Data recorded includes:
- Mean values of knee peak torque for knee extensors and flexors muscle groups for both left and right sides.
- Time to Peak Torque for knee flexors and extensors.
- Total work done (Twork) for knee extensors and flexors muscle conditions (both left and right extremities).
- Mean 3-RM (Three Repetition Maximum) strength.
- Mechanical and physiological variables during the Wingate test including:
  - Peak Power
  - Mean Power
  - Total Work
  - Fatigue Index
  - Lactate concentration

Potential data left out might include long-term effects of the supplement. Although the study focuses only on the direct short-term impact of the supplement its long-term effects could be a big factor as to whether consumers buy the product.

### 6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

The results were presented using p-values to demonstrate the improvement in performance between control groups and groups who had taken the supplement. The evidence provided supports the hypothesis that the supplement has a beneficial effect on anaerobic performance.

### 7. How was this study funded?

The article explicitly states in the Funding section that the research did not receive any external funding. This means that the study was either self-funded or funded by the institution the researchers are associated with.

### 8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I don’t think it had a major impact because most “publish or perish” papers focus on getting results to back up a controversial or new hypothesis. This paper on the other hand focused on getting their own results to come to a heavily debated topic: whether caffeine-based supplements increase anaerobic performance. Additionally, the study was not funded by any organization that may want to promote the supplement used in the tests. However, just because they were not funded by a supplement company the positive results from this experiment could be used to promote a product in the future.
